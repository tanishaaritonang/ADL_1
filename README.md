# 🧠 Adaptive Computer Network Learning Platform  

## 📘 Overview  
A full-stack adaptive learning platform designed to help students master computer networking through AI-generated, personalized learning paths.  

All content, quizzes, and feedback — from pre-test to post-test — are generated dynamically by a fine-tuned AI model and grounded with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) via Supabase for factual accuracy and contextual relevance.  

The system automatically evaluates each learner’s level (*Easy*, *Medium*, *High*) and provides real-time AI feedback per question, creating a personalized and interactive learning experience.

## 🚀 Core Features  

🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The platform implements a secure and straightforward authentication system using NextAuth.js with an email and password credential flow. This system provides seamless integration with Supabase as the primary user data source while maintaining a clean, privacy-preserving authentication experience.

✉️ Login & Registration

Users can register and log in using their email and password. During registration, account credentials are securely stored in Supabase with hashed passwords. Upon successful login, NextAuth manages session creation and maintains user authentication across pages using encrypted, HTTP-only cookies.

🧾 User Profiles

Each authenticated user is linked to a record in the profiles table within Supabase. The profile contains essential information such as email, full name, and role designation (student or instructor). This ensures consistent data management and easy synchronization between the authentication system and other platform features like quizzes, feedback, and analytics.

🔄 Session Management

NextAuth uses JWT-based session handling to ensure secure, persistent login sessions. Sessions remain active across the frontend and backend, allowing both client components and server API routes to recognize authenticated users without exposing sensitive information.

🧭 Access Control

The authentication system includes role-based access control (RBAC):

Students have access to learning modules, quizzes, AI feedback, and personal analytics.

Instructors have extended permissions to access class dashboards, track performance metrics, and review student progress.

Protected routes enforce access restrictions automatically. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page, and instructors’ pages are only accessible to users with the correct role assignment.

🧰 Integration with Supabase

Supabase serves as the central identity and data store. NextAuth retrieves and validates user credentials directly against Supabase’s stored data. When users log in, their role and basic details are fetched to build a complete session object used across the application.

🔒 Security Measures

Passwords are hashed before storage to ensure data safety.

Authentication sessions are protected by secure cookies to prevent unauthorized access.

JWT tokens are signed with a strong secret for session validation.

All API routes performing sensitive operations verify active user sessions before execution.

🚪 Logout & Session Expiry

Users can log out at any time, immediately invalidating their session. Inactive sessions automatically expire after a set period for added protection.

### 🧑‍🎓 Student Experience  
- Module Selection: Choose networking topics (e.g., OSI Model, Subnetting, Routing).  
- Pre-Test (30 Questions):  
  - Automatically generated by AI using RAG context.  
  - Immediate feedback after each question:  
    - Indicates correctness (✅ / ❌)  
    - Provides a short explanation  
    - Cites the source (*Refs*) from RAG  
- AI-Determined Level Placement:  
  - Based on pre-test performance.  
  - Levels: *Easy*, *Medium*, *High*.  
- Adaptive Learning Path:  
  - AI generates level-appropriate materials and 10–15 practice questions.  
  - Each question includes instant feedback and references.  
- Post-Test (30 Questions):  
  - Level-matched exam to fairly measure mastery.  
  - Each question includes AI-generated feedback and RAG citations.  
- Final AI Feedback Summary:  
  - Personalized report including:  
    - Scores and level achieved  
    - Strengths and weaknesses  
    - Recommended next steps  
    - List of referenced sources (from RAG retrieval)

## 🤖 AI Integration  

- Full AI Automation:  
  - Pre-test, module content, practice quizzes, post-test, and feedback are generated entirely by AI.  
- RAG Contextual Grounding (via Supabase):  
  - AI retrieves top contextual documents using `pgvector` embeddings stored in Supabase.  
  - Prevents hallucination and ensures every explanation is sourced from real material.  
- AI Feedback Loop:  
  - Feedback is generated both per question and at the end of each module.  
  - End feedback summarizes progress, weaknesses, and suggested learning paths.  
- Local Model Serving:  
  - Using Ollama for privacy-preserving inference with minimal latency.

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Conceptual Overview)  

Supabase (PostgreSQL + `pgvector`) manages both user data and retrieval documents.  

### Key Entities  
- profiles – user and instructor information (linked to Supabase Auth)  
- modules – list of networking learning modules  
- placements – AI-assigned difficulty level per student per module  
- attempts – records of pre-test, practice, and post-test attempts  
- items – stores each question, options, correct answer, explanation, and RAG references  
- rag_documents – source materials for retrieval (e.g., textbooks, lecture notes, RFCs)  
- rag_chunks – embedded vector chunks for RAG similarity search (`pgvector`)  

### Schema Highlights  
- RAG Grounding: `rag_chunks` enable precise retrieval of relevant text for AI context.  
- Question Feedback: Each `item` record contains per-question feedback and references.  
- Adaptive Placement: `placements` table automatically updates after pre-test completion.
